who is this?
you're at the lab?
and you don't have a keyboard??
there is an explanation... You escaped from the loop... didn't you?
ok, first of all...
find a portal
second thing, once you're at the portal, you'll need coordinates to go to
my current coordinates are~x = 5, y = 3, z = 9






what?






oh... I see...
portal is not powered...
listen...
I can't reach power substation
at least now...

so you are stuck and have to wait...
unlill somebody will power portal...
don't worry, lab has everything to keep you alive





lonely?
you can talk to me anytime you want
well, not really talk but...
do you want me to read you haiku?
this is submachine~endless world, mortal human~you are not alone

if you get lonely ping me again...
